                    <h5>Why do we need a clear overview of all the logs?</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To know about errors before many users notice them :)</li>
                        <li>To see how users are using CDS (are the new features popular?)</li>
                        <li>To provide statistics for our users (<em> How many times my paper was downloaded ?</em>) and other services at CERN (<em>How many time this video was played?</em>)</li>
                        <li>To see how many resources are used (CPU, RAM, etc.) and decide if it's time to scale up or not</li>
                        <li>To be able to predict if we need to scale before incoming events (based on the historical data)</li>

                    <p>
                        We decided to switch to one system for all our logs.<br>
                        Since the Elasticsearch was getting more and more popular, we decided to use it.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elasticsearch is part of the ELK stack:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elasticsearch - a search server</li>
                            <li>Logstash - transportation layer</li>
                            <li>Kibana - presentation layer</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Write how many machines we have used, how much data we store, what is the load and for long will it last (before we have to scale up)?</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Write about custom improvements:
                        <ul>
                            <li>NGINX configuration instead of paid Shield</li>
                            <li>Flagging bots</li>

                <section>
                    <p>Kibana works very nice for administrators, but we might need something more in the future (probably a module integrated directly in Invenio, with some predefined parameters and Role Based Access Control).</p>

                <section>
                    <h5>Current state</h5>
                    <p>We are still in the phase of transition between the <em>old way</em> (MySQL and Piwik) and the new one (Elasticsearch), as we are still supporting both versions of CDS, but we can clearly see the benefits of this change.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>The good parts:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We were able to replace two different tools (both of them doing similar tasks - gathering statistics) with a single one</li>
                        <li>Thanks to easy and minimal setup needed to run Kibana, we could start visualizing the data right away</li>
                        <li>Elasticsearch is a very adaptable infrastructure. You can easily add new machines to the cluster</li>
                        <li>If you are not happy with any part of ELK, you can easily replace it. There are many open source alternatives for each of it's part.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>There are no bad parts, but be aware to not treat Elasticsearch as an error-proof black box, then you install once and it works no matter what. There are some resources that will be depleted quicker than other (memory, for example), so spend some time configuring it properly, to make the most of your Elasticsearch installation and avoid troubles in the future.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                <h4>Thank you!</h4>
                <p>You were an awesome audience!<br>
                I wish I could be there, but you know, I'm taking the last change to see Black Sabbath live, so I think you will understand.<br>
                I just hope Esteban won't screw up this awesome presentation.</p>
